An interactive Twitter Bot.

#### Python Library Dependencies:
tweepy - python wrapper for Twitter API  
markovify - probability-based text generation algorithm  
mySQL - database of text snippets scraped from elsewhere on twitter  

#### Installing
* install dependencies
    * `pip3 install mysql-connector`. Normal `pip` installs an older version not compatible with Python3.
* register for a [Twitter Developer account](https://developer.twitter.com/) - this is necessary to obtain login credentials for the bot and access the Twitter API for scraping and publishing. 
* we run on an Amazon AWS EC2 server. You can run locally or from the server of your choice. Clone the repo to your destination. 

#### Deployment
* login settings
* setup database?
* run configuration.py. 
* you're running!
